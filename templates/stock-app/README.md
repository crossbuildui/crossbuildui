# Welcome to your Crossbuild UI Expo App ðŸ‘‹

This is a minimal Expo project template, bootstrapped with `create-expo-app` and pre-configured with Crossbuild UI theming (using `@crossbuildui/core` package).

It provides a basic structure to start working on your Expo app using CrossBuildUI components and global styles. The Crossbuild UI theme is already integrated, allowing the app to automatically adapt to your device's light/dark mode.

## Get started

To get started with this template, simply follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
