- Attribution (Developer): The user agrees to acknowledge Crossbuild UI as the developer of the Custom Component in a reasonable and mutually agreed-upon manner, typically in the project's source code comments or documentation. This attribution does not grant CrossBuild UI any ownership rights over the Custom Component.

3. Subscription-Based License Validity and Transferability

3.1 License Validity

Your license to use Paid Components for Commercial Use is valid only for the duration of your active subscription on www.crossbuildui.com

- Upon termination of your subscription, you must cease all use of Paid Components entirely.
- Free Components remain unaffected: Your right to use Free Components with proper attribution continues regardless of subscription status.

3.2 Non-Transferability

A subscription purchased by an individual, team, or organization is valid exclusively for that specific individual, team, or organization.

- The license granted under an active subscription is strictly non-transferable. It cannot be transferred, sold, leased, or sublicensed to any other individual, team, or organization.
- There are no specific user or project limits within an active subscription for the purchasing entity, unless explicitly stated otherwise in a separate enterprise agreement.
